# Vertical Farm Project Documentation

Welcome to the documentation hub for our vertical farming initiative. This site contains two key resources:

1. **Project Study** - A comprehensive research document covering the design, implementation, and theoretical framework of our vertical farming system.
2. **Pilot Scale Study** - Detailed documentation of our small-scale prototype, including methodology, system, instrumentations, costing, and theoretical yield.

## How to Access These Documents

To navigate to either document:

1. Click the **â‰¡ menu button** in the top-left corner of the page
2. Select either:
   - "Project Study" for the full research document
   - "Pilot Study - Budget Report" for the prototype documentation

Both documents are also accessible through the left sidebar when viewing on desktop.
